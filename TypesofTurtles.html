                    <p>In Sri Lanka, the green turtle is the frequently sighted. They live in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Young green turtles are mostly carnivores. Adults, however, are herbivores that use their sharply serrated jaws to only consume marine vegetation. They can weigh up to 250 kg and reach a maximum length of 1m. A mature female will typically lay 120-140 eggs at a cycle.</p>

                    <p>More uncommon than the Green Turtle is the severely endangered Hawksbill Turtle. Additionally, it is significantly smaller, with a maximum length of 90 cm and a weight range of 50-70 kg. The hawksbill's tiny head and bird-like beak, which are employed to hunt creatures hidden in small cracks, are what give it its English name. It frequently travels to tropical and subtropical seas, including Sri Lanka. Despite being one of the lesser sea turtle species, this one is recognized for having a stunning shell that is composed of 13 symmetrical sections and is incredibly colorful.</p>

                    <p>The Loggerhead Turtle is uncommon in Sri Lanka and more frequent in the East Coast of the United States. As their name implies, they are often red and brown in color, and their huge head makes them easy to recognize. It weights between 170 and 200kg and reaches a height of 1m. They are mostly carnivores, and their powerful jaws are perfect for tearing apart mollusks and crustaceans.</p>

                    <p>Olive Ridley turtle has been classified as endangered. The Olive Ridley turtle, the smaller of the two species of ridley turtles, grows to a maximum size of 65 cm and weighs 35-45 kg. It gets its name from the color of its rusty-olive shell. Every year, Olive Ridley Turtles lay their eggs, and many of them deposit more than 150 at once on Kosgoda Beach. They consume fish, crabs, and some marine plants since they are omnivores.<p>

                    <h8>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h8><br><br>
                    <p>This largest of the five kinds of turtle, which is severely endangered and very rare to find in Sri Lanka. It is still in danger of going extinct. Long front flippers and a distinctive shell with black and white stripes make it easy to recognize; the carapace, which gives the creature a leathery look, is actually a layer of thick, rubbery skin dotted with hundreds of bone plates. In actuality, it is the only sea turtle that does not have a hard shell. Additionally, despite being a cold-blooded reptile, they have a special blood circulation system that enables them to use the metabolic heat generated by their muscular activity to keep their blood warm even in chilly waters. The Leatherback may grow up to 3 meters long and weigh 750 kg. They can descend to depths of 1500 meters in the pursuit of their favorite prey, the jellyfish, due to their distinctive flexible carapace and its seven ridges. Each year, Kosgoda Beach is reported to be the nesting site for 5 leatherback turtles.</p>
