                    <p>The Sea Turtle Hatchery and Rescue Center, which aims to preserve some of the world's endangered turtle species, is located a few kilometers north of the main Hikkaduwa town. The southern shore of the island is home to a number of turtle hatcheries, including this one. It began as a community initiative to help save the southern coast's biodiversity, but it has now developed into a full-fledged hatchery and rescue facility with devoted personnel who toil around the clock to research, look after, and safeguard various turtle species. <br><br>The hatchery and rescue facility now cares for five different kinds of turtles. These species include the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center, which also cares for adult turtle species that have been pulled from the water after suffering injuries. The place where the turtles lay their eggs, which has distinct small mounds of sand heaped neatly between one another. The turtle eggs' hatching process is carefully tracked at each of these mounds.
