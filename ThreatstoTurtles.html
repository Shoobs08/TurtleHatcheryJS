                        <p>Tens of thousands of sea turtles are said to perish each year as a result of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded as bycatch. Additionally, the disturbance to their food source and environment has an effect on those that are able to evade fishing nets.<br><br><br>Turtle excluder devices (TEDs), which enable sea turtles to safely escape from the nets, are being promoted by fisheries to use in shrimp trawlers.

                        <p>Sea turtles are harmed by marine pollution in a number of ways. Sea turtles are harmed by ingesting and being entangled in waste such as plastic trash, fishing gear left out to sea, petroleum contaminants, and other objects. The immune systems of the turtles may be weakened by ocean pollution, which may also interfere with nesting habits and hatchling orientation.<br><br><br>To keep our beaches and ocean clean, take part in coastal cleanups and cut back on plastic consumption. Sea turtles and other marine life can be harmed by trash in the water. Bring reusable bags and water bottles.

                        <p>The extent to which sea turtles can be impacted by climate change is only now coming to light. Climate change has the potential to alter the natural gender distribution of hatchlings, raise the risk of disease outbreaks, and increase the frequency of extreme weather conditions that devastate coral reefs and beaches used for nesting.<br><br><br>Reducing your carbon footprint is a quick and simple way to help sea turtles and all marine life. For example be sure sure to switch off the lights before leaving a room and plugging in appliances that are not in use might still drain energy even when they are switched off. Use power strips to make it simpler to turn off several devices at once. Doing this is a start and ensures the wellbeing of turtles in the long run.</p>
