                    <p>The project started by Dudley Perera in 1988.  The project's major goals are to keep an eye on local sea turtle activities and protect nearby nesting areas.  We want people to understand how vulnerable these lovely animals are and how crucial it is to contribute to their protection before it's too late.<br><br><br>The project's hatchery is one of its most vital parts. Before being put back into the water, saved and gathered eggs can safely develop within the project's sanctuary away from predators. Additionally, a specific number of each hatching is held back for a brief time for head start prior to release. The goal of the hatchery program is to increase the number of hatchlings that make it to the ocean and endure the difficult early stages of life.</p>

                    <p2>At the project, you'll not only learn a lot about turtles for yourself, but you'll also get the chance to share your knowledge with others. Volunteers will have the opportunity to participate in giving tours of the project and teaching some of their newly gathered information to residents and visitors. The conservation of these intriguing animals depends on public understanding of them, their threats, and how to protect them.</p2>
