                <p>Sea turtles have traveled vast distances throughout the oceans of the planet for over 100 million years, playing a crucial role in maintaining the harmony of marine habitats.</p>
                <br><p>An essential link in marine ecosystems is provided by sea turtles. They contribute to the preservation of the coral reefs and seagrass beds that support fisheries for tuna, shrimp, and other species with high commercial value. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. The value of turtles as a tourist attraction is significant culturally. Around the world, five of the seven species are present, mostly in tropical and subtropical waters. The remaining two species, however, have much smaller geographic ranges.Their habitat is the open water and they are know to live in the ocean for their entire life expect when it comes to breeding, where they will beach themselves to lay the eggs.</p>

                <p4>A sea turtle's life begins when a female lays her eggs on a nesting beach, which is often in the tropics. A tiny hatchling emerges from the sand and makes its way to the water between six weeks to two months (based on the species), dodging every kind of predator along the way.</p4>

                <div class="cycle"> 
                    <p5><li>Hatchlings begin their lives as eggs that are laid in nests on beaches all over the world. When they are prepared to hatch, they use an egg tooth (also known as a "caruncle") to break out of the egg, crawl carefully up the sand until they reach the surface, and then migrate toward the water</li><br>
                    <li>They set sail to the ocean as juvenile turtles. We often have no idea where they go from there, which is why we refer to them as "the lost years." Usually during this time period they feed and grow</li><br>
                    <li>When they are fully grown, they return to their original birthplace to mate. When ready, adult females will come up onto the nesting beach to lay their eggs, restarting the cycle.</li></p5>
