                    <p>All visitors to Bentota enjoy visiting the popular Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project. The beautiful golden sands that attract you to our island also provide numerous endangered turtle species, such the Olive Ridley and Leatherback turtles, a fascinating breeding site. The project's objective is to preserve and safeguard the eggs against predators and other threats.<br><br><br>When the eggs arrive at the hatchery, they are carefully buried in sand until they break free of their shells, at which point they are transported and put into tanks where they will spend the first few days of their life. This increases their chances of surviving by giving them a chance to get stronger before being returned to the dangers of the water. In this way, several turtle species are protected.</p>

                    <p2>The newborn turtles are released on the beach at sunset, and you can watch them make their way back to the ocean. Visitors are urged to use caution while young turtles are released back into the water. Loud sounds, bright lights, and flash photography are prohibited because they might cause newborn turtles to mistake them for the moon over the water, which would prevent them from finding their way back home.</p2>
